School project.

Criteria:
Final Project will consist, mainly, of developing a basic web site (at least two to three levels deep), that conforms to responsive design principals, and that is ADA and Mobile compliant.

The site will be accessible, usable, and viewable on Mac and Windows desktops (using the three-to-five main main popular browsers for each platform); viewable on mobile (smartphone and tablet devices), and tagged and closed-captioned (or transcripted) for ADA accessibility. All content and media components will comport with/be compatible with desktop, mobile, and ADA usability standards.

All project components will have been fully tested for these things by the student and validated as functional, against a (submitted) test script of acceptance criteria, before the project is submitted. (If the student does not have, say, a Windows machine, or a tablet, they will be expected to develop a test script and have a friend or family member with such equipment test for functional acceptance criteria.)
